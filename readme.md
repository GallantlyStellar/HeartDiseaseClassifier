# Analysis of Heart Disease with One-Versus-Rest Logistic Regression

This repository is adapted from a project that was part of my academic program. It has been re-uploaded here with minor changes as a part of my portfolio.

A classification model was created to predict heart disease stage based on input features. Please see [the report PDF in this repo](./report.pdf) for a description of the analysis and walkthrough.
